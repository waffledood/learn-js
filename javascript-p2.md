# JavaScript Syntax - Part 2

## Arrays 

### Declaring Arrays with `let` & `const`

You may recall that you can declare variables with both the `let` and `const` keywords. Variables declared with `let` can be reassigned whilst variables declared with the `const` keyword cannot be reassigned. 

However, elements in an array declared with `const` remain mutable. Meaning that we can change the contents of a `const` array, but cannot reassign a new array or a different value to the `const` variable.

```js
let array1 = ['spoon', 'fork']
let array2 = ['milk', 'cereal']

array1[0] = 'knife'                 // allowed!
array2[0] = 'kiwi'                  // allowed!

array1 = ['knife', 'soup spoon']    // allowed!
array2 = ['kiwi', 'almond']         // not allowed!
```

Note:
- In JavaScript, declaring an array with the keyword `const` means that variable will always be holding an array of a certain size (size of the array it was declared with) throughout its lifetime.

### `.length` property of arrays

We can use the `.length` property to find out the length of arrays.

```js
let array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(array1.length);
```

### Array Operations 

1. `push(item)`
   - Appends an item to the end of the array.
2. `pop()`
   - Removes the last item of the array. 

Further details on Array operations can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).

### Data Type of Arrays

Similar to Python, JavaScript arrays can store different data types in an array. These means string, arrays, integers can all reside within the same array.

`const sampleArray = ['waffles', 123, ['pancakes', 'maple syrup'], 2.43];`

## For Loops 

For Loops help us iterate over an array, or repeat the same block of code over & over again. 

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    // do something
}
```

## For-Of Loops 

A permutation of the For Loop is the For-Of Loop. This is similar to Java's `for-each` loop.

```js
const hobbies = ['singing', 'eating', 'quidditch', 'writing'];
 
for (const hobby of hobbies) {
  console.log(`I enjoy ${hobby}.`);
}
```

JavaScript's `for-of` loop can be used to iterate through characters of a String.

```js
const username = 'joe';
 
for (const char of username) {
  console.log(char);
}

/*
    The above prints:
    j
    o
    e
*/
```

Java's `for-each` loop looks like this:

```java
int[] arr = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

for (int i: arr) {
    System.out.println("item: " + i);
}
```

## While Loops 

While Loops help us iterate over a block of code as long as a conditional statement is met. 

```js
while (/* conditional statement */) {
    // do something
}
```

## Do-While Loops 

Do-While Loops **execute a block of code once**, before repeatedly executing that block of code as long as a conditional statement is met.

```js
do {
    // do something 
} while (/* conditional statement */);
```

## Other useful statements & declarations / control flow logic

- `break`
  terminates the current loop, switch, or label statement and transfers program control to the statement following the terminated statement
- `continue`
  terminates the current execution & goes to the next iteration

## Objects 

Objects can be assigned to variables just like any JavaScript type. We use curly braces, {}, to designate an object literal:

`let spaceShip = {}; // spaceShip is an empty object literal`

We fill an object with unordered data. This data is organized into key-value pairs.

We make a key-value pair by writing the keyâ€™s name, or identifier, followed by a colon and then the value. We separate each key-value pair in an object literal with a comma (,). Keys are strings, but when we have a key that does not have any special characters in it, JavaScript allows us to omit the quotation marks:

### Accessing Properties 

There are 2 ways we can access an object's property: 
1. dot notation `.`
   ![object_dot_notation](docs/js-p2/object_dot_notation.svg)
   We can access the property of an object by directly calling it with the dot operator:
   ```js
   let spaceShip = {
      homePlanet: 'Earth',
      color: 'silver'
   }
   spaceship.homePlanet; // Returns 'Earth'
   spaceship.color; // Returns 'silver'
   ```
