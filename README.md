## Data Types 
- Number (Primitive)
  any number, including numbers with decimals, (`2`, `3.142`, `100`)
- String (Primitive)
  grouping of characters on your keyboard, (`"this is a String"`, `'this is also a String'`)
- Boolean (Primitive)
  boolean values are only ever 1 of 2 values (`true`, `false`)
- Null (Primitive)
  this data type represents the intentional absnce of a value, and is represented by the keyword `null` (without quotes!)
- Undefined (Primitive)
  this data type is denoted by the keyword `undefined` (without quotes). It also represents the absence of a value although it has a different use than `null`. `undefined` means that a given value does not exist
- Symbol (Primitive)
  A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding. No need to worry about these for now.
- Object
  Collections of related data.
